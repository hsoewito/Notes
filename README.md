# test-repo README file
## Secondary heading
### Tertiary heading
This is a test repo README file.
I just updated this from local repository.
Then I used the following commands:
  * git commit -a -m "Update again"
  * git push (to push it to remote repository.)
  * If modified in github, use 'git pull origin master' to sync local files with remote files.
